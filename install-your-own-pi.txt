First, download raspbian image from: 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
We use Wheezy on the lab PIs, I think either will work.

Write the image to an sd card. On windows I used Win32diskimager
http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/?source=typ_redirect

Make raspberry pi talk to the grovepi (via I2C)
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
Start up the raspberry pi with a screen/keyboard (you can connect hdmi to screens in the lab, ask us if you need a keyboard (or unplug from lab machines))
1) It will start up in raspb-config, select "expand filesystem"
2) Select advanced options
3) Select I2C, and press yes to everything - I2C is how the raspberry pi talks to the grovepi board
4) Finish, select reboot now. Wait for it to come back
5) Log in (pi / raspberry)

6)Connect to the wifi network or an ethernet cable.
If you're in the computer lab, you can connect to UoN secure. To do this:
 
type:
 sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
 
paste into that conf file exactly the below, except with your username and password in there:

network={
ssid="UoN-secures"
key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
eap=PEAP MSCHAPV2
identity="<your username eg:pszpw2"
password="<your password eg:mylovelypassword"
}

or for a home network it looks like this:

network={
ssid="Joe and Penny"
proto=RSN
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
pairwise=CCMP TKIP
group=CCMP TKIP
psk="your network password"
}

7)Restart wifi
type: sudo ifdown wlan0 
sudo ifup wlan0


8) update everything
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

8)  Install useful i2c utilities:
sudo apt-get install python-smbus
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

9) make sure kernel support for i2c is reallyu on
sudo nano /boot/config.txt 
Add the lines:
dtparam=i2c1=on
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
to the end of the file


9)Check it is talking to the grovepi
sudo i2cdetect -y
